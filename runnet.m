%%%% This function runs the network without learning. It take as an

%%%% the Input of the network, the recurrent connectivity matrix C, the feedforward
%%%% connectivity matrix F, the number of neurons Nneuron, the length of
%%%% the Input Ntime, and the Threhsold. It returns the spike trains O
%%%% the filterd spike trains rO, and the membrane potentials V.
